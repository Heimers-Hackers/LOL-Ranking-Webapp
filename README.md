# LOL-Ranking-Webapp

League of Legends power rankings project for the Devpost Global Power Rankings Hackathon. 

Our project trains various classical machine learning models to predict individual League of Legends game outcomes using statistics
from previous games.  We then use these models to create League of Legends esports power rankings by simulating our own round robin tournaments.
These results are displayed on a web application that allows users to rank various combinations of teams.
